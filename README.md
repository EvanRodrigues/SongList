# SongList

A website to display a collection of songs. It is meant to emulate the functionality and display of iTunes. I originally completed this project in 2017, but in 2019 I felt that it needed an overhaul.

## Tech Stack

This site was developed using Bootstrap, SASS, jQuery, PHP, and mySQL.

## Functionality

-   The table can be updated by searching for a title or an artist.
-   Categories can be sorted ascending or descending by pressing the corresponding category name in the table header.
-   As the scrollbar reaches the bottom of the table body, an ajax request will fill the table with more songs.

## What I Learned

-   Bootstrap grid.
-   Mobile first design.
-   Ajax requests.

## Future Plans

-   Remove duplicate songs with SQL.
-   Improve mobile layout.
-   Optimize PHP and JavaScript functions.
